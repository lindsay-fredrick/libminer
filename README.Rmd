The goal of libminer is to provide a summary of a user's R libraries. 
It's a toy package developed in a workshop and not meant for serious use. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of libminer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lindsay-fredrick/libminer")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(libminer)

lib_summary()

# You can also ask it to calculate sizes:
lib_summary(sizes = TRUE)
```
